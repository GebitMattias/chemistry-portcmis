Change log 
----------

PortCMIS 0.1:

Initial relase

  
Strong-Name signing
-------------------

The DLL included in this release is signed with a public/private key pair that is also 
included in this package. This allows you to deploy it to the global assembly cache (GAC) 
and to make changes to the PortCMIS source code without recompiling your application.
However, since the private key is publicly available, this strong name cannot be trusted.
If a trust relationship between your application and the PortCMIS DLL is important to you, 
you have to rebuild the DLL from the source code and sign it yourself.
